Hi, I'm a junior at the University of Rochester studying Computer Science, with a minor in Political Science and cluster in Media Studies.

Summer 2023: I interned for the software engineering team at [LiquiDonate](https://liquidonate.com/), working on extending their core marketplace products to APIs and building internal tools for the sales/operations teams.

Summer 2024: I was a research assistant under Professor [Yukang Yan](https://rochester-bear-lab.github.io/), supported by the [Schwartz Discover Grant](https://www.rochester.edu/college/ugresearch/funding/discover-grant/index.html) and worked on automatically generating a unified Mixed Reality (MR) interface for multiple environments at once.

My main interests are in Computer Vision, Computer Systems/Architecture, and Mixed Reality.
